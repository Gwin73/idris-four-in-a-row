# idris-four-in-a-row
Terminal version of the classic game Four In A Row implemented in the dependently typed functional programming language Idris. Compile with the command "idris main.idr -o main". One case in the proof lemma in utils.idr is uncompleted, because I don't how it can be proven in Idris.
